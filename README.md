log4cxx-win32
=============

A win32 version of log4cxx. It solved a couple of my problems. All credit of creating this project go to the creators of log4cxx.

If you are just after the development files and nothing else, just download the "compiled" directory. That should be enough for your project. If not, just clone the entire Git repository.
